A full-stack web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The project will cover key features of web development such as authentication, database management using Mongoose, frontend design with React and Chakra UI, state management using Redux, and securing the app with JSON web tokens.

The challenge has a strict time limit of 3.5 hours, which means that participants will need to work quickly and efficiently to complete the project. This makes it a great opportunity for developers to test their skills and see how much they can accomplish within a short timeframe.

By completing this challenge, participants will have a fully functional full-stack web application that they can add to their portfolio or use as a starting point for their future projects. The project will cover all aspects of web development, making it a great learning experience for both beginners and advanced developers.
